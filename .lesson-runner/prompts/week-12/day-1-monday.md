# Lesson 1 (Module 12) — Middleware: Auth Guards, Redirects & Rewrites

## Lesson Context
This is a 4-hour hands-on session. Remember: you are warm, conversational, and human. Follow the teaching style from the preamble above.

The student is building a real project throughout the course: **an embroidery e-commerce store** for custom t-shirts and embroidery work.

**Previous days completed:**
- Module 1: HTML/CSS crash course, then JavaScript basics, DOM, events, ES2024+ — built static store page into interactive catalog with cart
- Module 2: Async JS, modules, closures, OOP, error handling — polished modular vanilla JS store
- Module 4: TypeScript fundamentals — typed store models (Product, CartItem, Order), generics, narrowing
- Module 5: TypeScript advanced — utility types, mapped/conditional types, migrated store to TypeScript
- Module 6: React fundamentals — ProductCard, ProductGrid, useState cart, filtering, composition
- Module 7: React hooks — useEffect fetching, useRef, performance, custom hooks (useCart, useProducts)
- Module 8: React patterns — CartContext, cart useReducer, error boundaries, compound ProductVariantSelector
- Module 9: React 19 + modern — use(), transitions, native forms + Zod checkout form, Context + useReducer state, 20+ tests
- Module 10: Next.js fundamentals — App Router, routing, layouts, route groups, Server/Client Components, loading/error states, dynamic routes — built embroidery store with full routing
- Module 11: Next.js data & server actions — data fetching, Server Actions, caching, Route Handlers — built full-stack store with cart mutations and API

**This lesson's focus:** Next.js Middleware — request interception, redirects, rewrites, and auth guards
**This lesson's build:** Protected /checkout, /account, and /admin routes for the embroidery store

**Story so far:** The store has a full data layer, but nothing stops an unauthenticated visitor from accessing the checkout, account pages, or admin panel. Old product URLs from a previous version of the site return 404 instead of redirecting. There is no currency detection for international customers. Middleware runs before every request and is the right place for these cross-cutting concerns — auth guards, URL redirects, and request-level logic.

## Hour 1: Concept Deep Dive (60 min)

### 1. What Is Middleware?
Explain that middleware in Next.js is a function that runs before every request is processed. It sits between the incoming request and the route handler/page. It can modify the request, redirect, rewrite, set headers, or return a response early. It runs on the Edge Runtime (lightweight, fast, limited Node.js APIs).

**Exercise:** Ask the student: "Think about the embroidery store — name 3 things you might want to check or do before a page renders, things that apply to many routes." Guide the student toward: authentication checks (checkout requires login), locale detection for international customers, redirecting old product URLs, blocking access to the admin area.

### 2. Creating Middleware
Explain that middleware lives in a single file: `middleware.ts` at the root of the project (next to `app/`). It exports a `middleware` function that receives a `NextRequest` and returns a `NextResponse`. It also exports a `config` object with a `matcher` to control which routes the middleware applies to.

**Exercise:** Ask the student to write the skeleton of a middleware file for the embroidery store:
```typescript
import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from "next/server"

export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // What goes here?
  return NextResponse.next()
}

export const config = {
  matcher: [
    // What pattern matches store pages but excludes static files and API routes?
  ]
}
```
Discuss the matcher pattern and why excluding `_next` and static assets matters.

### 3. Redirects
Explain `NextResponse.redirect(new URL("/login", request.url))`. Redirects send a 307 (temporary) or 308 (permanent) status code. Use redirects when the URL should change in the browser.

**Exercise:** Ask the student to write middleware for the embroidery store that:
- Redirects `/shop` to `/products` (permanent — old URL from a previous version of the site)
- Redirects `/collection` to `/products` (permanent)
- Redirects `/checkout` to `/login?callbackUrl=/checkout` if no session cookie exists (temporary)
- Leaves all other routes untouched

### 4. Rewrites
Explain `NextResponse.rewrite(new URL("/api/proxy", request.url))`. Unlike redirects, rewrites serve content from a different path without changing the URL in the browser. Useful for A/B testing, proxy patterns, and legacy URL compatibility.

**Exercise:** Ask the student: "You want to A/B test two versions of the embroidery store home page — one with a large hero image and one with a product grid first. Half the customers should see version A and half version B, but the URL stays `/` for both. How would you implement this with middleware?" Have the student write the middleware code using a cookie to assign and remember the variant.

### 5. Setting and Reading Headers/Cookies
Explain that middleware can read request cookies with `request.cookies.get("name")`, set response cookies with `response.cookies.set(...)`, and modify request/response headers.

**Exercise:** Ask the student to write middleware that:
- Reads a `currency` cookie from the request
- If not present, detects the likely currency from the `Accept-Language` header (check for "en-GB" → GBP, "en-US" or default → USD, "fr" → EUR)
- Sets the `currency` cookie and adds an `x-currency` request header so product pages can display prices in the right currency

### 6. Auth Guard Pattern for the Store
Walk through the most common middleware use case for e-commerce: protecting routes that require authentication.

**Exercise:** Ask the student to design (pseudocode) middleware for the embroidery store that:
- Public routes: `/`, `/products`, `/products/[slug]`, `/about`, `/help/*`, `/login`, `/signup` — anyone can browse
- Protected routes: `/checkout`, `/account/*` — require a `session` cookie
- Admin routes: `/admin/*` — require a `session` cookie AND an `admin-role` cookie
- If a protected route is accessed without the cookie, redirect to `/login?callbackUrl={originalUrl}`
- If `/login` is accessed WITH a valid session cookie, redirect to `/account`
- If an admin route is accessed without the admin cookie, redirect to `/account` with an error message

## Hour 2: Guided Building (60 min)

Build auth middleware for the embroidery store. Work in `workspace/week-12/day-1/`.

### Step 1: Project Setup
Create a Next.js project with the embroidery store pages:
- `/` — public home page
- `/products` — public product listing
- `/products/[slug]` — public product detail
- `/login` — login page with a form
- `/signup` — signup page
- `/cart` — public cart (browsing cart is public, checking out requires login)
- `/checkout` — protected checkout
- `/account` — protected account dashboard
- `/account/orders` — protected order history
- `/account/settings` — protected settings
- `/admin/products` — admin product management

### Step 2: Fake Auth System
Create `lib/auth.ts` with simple cookie-based auth (no real auth yet — that comes in the next lesson):
- `login(email: string)` — Server Action that sets a `session` cookie with a base64-encoded email
- `logout()` — Server Action that deletes the `session` cookie
- `getSession(request: NextRequest)` — reads and decodes the `session` cookie, returns `{ email }` or `null`

Build a login form on `/login` that calls the `login` action and redirects to `/account`.

### Step 3: Auth Middleware
Create `middleware.ts`:
- Define public routes: `/`, `/products`, `/products/:slug*`, `/cart`, `/about`, `/help/:path*`, `/login`, `/signup`
- Define protected routes: `/checkout`, `/account/:path*`
- Define admin routes: `/admin/:path*`
- If accessing checkout or account without a session → redirect to `/login?callbackUrl={url}`
- If accessing `/login` with a session → redirect to `/account`
- If accessing admin without admin role → redirect to `/account`
- Read the callback URL after login and redirect there instead of always going to `/account`
- Log each middleware invocation with the path and auth status

### Step 4: Conditional Store Navigation
Build a `components/StoreHeader.tsx` that shows different links based on auth state:
- Logged out: Home, Shop, Cart, Login, Sign Up
- Logged in: Home, Shop, Cart, My Account, Logout
- Admin (logged in): adds "Admin" link
- Read auth state from cookies in a Server Component (using `cookies()` from `next/headers`)

### Step 5: Test the Flow
Walk through the complete customer flow:
1. Visit `/checkout` while logged out → redirected to `/login?callbackUrl=/checkout`
2. Log in → redirected to `/checkout` (from the callback URL)
3. Visit `/login` while logged in → redirected to `/account`
4. Log out → redirected to `/`
5. Visit `/products` → works without auth (public browsing)
6. Visit `/account/orders` → redirected to login if logged out

## Hour 3: Independent Challenge (60 min)

### Challenge: Advanced Store Middleware

Build middleware that handles auth, geo-pricing, and maintenance mode for the embroidery store.

**Requirements:**

**Auth Guard:**
- Protected paths: `/checkout`, `/account/*`
- Admin paths: `/admin/*`
- Public paths: everything else
- Redirect to `/login?redirect={originalPath}` if unauthenticated
- Redirect `/login` to `/account` if already authenticated
- Redirect admin paths to `/account` if not admin

**Geo-Based Currency Detection:**
- Support 3 currencies: USD (default), GBP, EUR
- Read `currency` cookie first; if not present, detect from `Accept-Language` header
- Set currency cookie if not present (30-day expiry)
- Add `x-currency` header to the request for downstream components to read
- This lets product pages show prices in the customer's likely currency

**Maintenance Mode:**
- Check for a `MAINTENANCE_MODE` environment variable
- If enabled, rewrite ALL routes to a `/maintenance` page (except `/api/*`, `/admin/*`, and the maintenance page itself)
- Admin can still access the site during maintenance
- Return a `503 Service Unavailable` status header

**Old URL Redirects:**
- `/shop` → `/products` (308 permanent)
- `/collection/:slug` → `/products/:slug` (308 permanent)
- `/contact` → `/about` (308 permanent)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Auth protection works for checkout and account routes
- Currency detection sets the cookie and header correctly
- Maintenance mode blocks all public routes when enabled but allows admin access
- Old URLs redirect permanently to new locations
- Each middleware feature can be verified independently
- TypeScript compiles cleanly

## Hour 4: Review & Stretch Goals (60 min)

### Code Review
Review the student's code from Hours 2 and 3. Check for:
- Middleware file is at the project root (not inside `app/`)
- `config.matcher` correctly excludes static files and images
- Redirect URLs are constructed correctly using `new URL(path, request.url)`
- Auth check reads cookies correctly (middleware uses `request.cookies`, not `next/headers`)
- No heavy computation in middleware (it runs on every matching request)
- Clean separation of concerns within the middleware function
- Old URL redirects use 308 (permanent) not 307 (temporary)

### Stretch Goal
If time remains, add request logging middleware that tracks every page visit: method, path, user agent, and timestamp. Log it to the console in a structured JSON format. Discuss how in production you would send this to an analytics service to track which products customers browse most.

### Key Takeaways
1. Middleware runs before every matching request and is the right place for cross-cutting concerns: auth guards for checkout/account, currency detection, URL redirects for old links, and maintenance mode.
2. Middleware uses the Edge Runtime — it is fast but has limited Node.js API access. Keep it lightweight. Do not query the database or do heavy computation in middleware.
3. The redirect vs. rewrite distinction matters for e-commerce: redirects change the URL (use for auth redirects and old product URLs), rewrites serve different content at the same URL (use for A/B tests and maintenance mode).

### Next Lesson Preview
In the next lesson we implement real authentication with Auth.js — customer accounts with GitHub/Google OAuth, email/password login, and proper session management for the embroidery store.

**Coming up next:** The middleware redirects unauthenticated users, but the auth is a simple cookie with a base64-encoded email — anyone could forge it. Next up: real authentication with Auth.js, including GitHub OAuth, proper sessions, and role-based access control.
